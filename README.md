# google_voice_autodialer
This script utilizes pyautogui to automate google voice to call numbers from a spreadsheet.

Press 'q' on you keyboard to cycle through numbers.

You have to open a browser window with google voice and make sure the xy coordinate variables in main.py align with the window position.
The default coordinates should work if the browser window is positioned like in the demo_video.mp4.
If you need to adjust the coordinates you can run xy_tool.py which will continuously print the xy location of your mouse on the screen.
